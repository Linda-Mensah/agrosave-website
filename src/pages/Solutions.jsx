            At Agrosave, we offer two distinct solar-powered cold storage
            services designed to serve both smallholder farmers and food
            businesses. Together, these solutions reduce post-harvest losses,
            improve incomes, and ensure the consistent availability of fresh
            produce.

              <h3>How it works:</h3>
              <p>
                We use solar-powered refrigerated vans to collect produce from
                farms and deliver it to urban areas while maintaining cold chain
                integrity during transport.
